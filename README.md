# WallChanger
A windows application to randomize your Wallpaper. 

Please use the release, rather than just running the python file. Also make sure the icon.ico is included in the directory when running! Have a seperate folder for images that you want to change your wallpaper to.  

Eventually I will update this project a bit more, adding some cool features like animated backgrounds, and a better GUI for choosing your wallpaper.
