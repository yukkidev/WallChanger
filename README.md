# WallChanger
A windows tray icon to randomize/change your Wallpaper. 

**Make sure the *icon.ico* is included in the directory when running!** Have a seperate folder for images that you want to change your wallpaper to.  

Eventually I will update this project a bit more, adding some cool features like animated backgrounds, and a better GUI for choosing your wallpaper. 

(V2 is still like on the backburner but will be hopefully released soon)
